    Are you hosting a conference that would consider partnering with SpeakEasy? 
    <p>
        <b>What Does It Mean?</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Cross-promotion: You mention us in your channels, we mention you in ours</li>
            <li>Access to new speakers who come with a mentor helping them improve their delivery</li>
            <li>Letting SpeakEasy know the numbers of submissions and selections on the SpeakEasy candidates</li>
            <li>You still decide which speakers you select!</li>
            <li>In most cases, SpeakEasy Speakers submit like the rest of your speakers, just mentioning SpeakEasy.</li>
            <li>We sometimes partner with conferences for building keynotes and tracks where we help with the selection process. 
                If that is something you are interested in, <a href="mailto: spkeazee@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.</li>
        </ul>
