    <p>SpeakEasy is a technical conference diversity initiative. It focuses on new voices from testing community
        to bridge the gap, in particular with number of women speakers. Founded by Fiona Charles and Anne-Marie
        Charrett, SpeakEasy operates through forming alliances with conferences and pairing new speakers with
        mentors helping them succeed with their talks. Over its existence, Speak Easy has been a significant
        contributor of new voices and high-quality content to international testing conferences.</p>

    <p>SpeakEasy is about to start a new chapter under a new leadership team, that wishes to pay tribute to the
        great initiative.</p>

    <h2>SpeakEasy 2.0 will:</h2>
    <div style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
            <li>Support partnering conferences in finding quality speakers, while funneling speakers also for open
                calls for proposals, local meetups and conferences, and international webinars.
            </li>
            <li>Increase diversity focusing on women and people of color, while within possibilities offering
                mentoring help for any new speakers.
            </li>
            <li>Support first time international conference speakers, yet also help speakers grow all the way to
                keynote grade with SpeakEasy support.
            </li>
            <li>Extend beyond a core practice of mentoring speakers to being a platform for sharing lessons on being
                and becoming a speaker.
            </li>
            <li>Grow speakers from test community to contribute to and engage with the general tech community.</li>
            <li>Continue to support speakers within the focus of quality software delivery while finding stages
                across a wider range of software delivery conferences.
            </li>
            <li>Raise money through voluntary fees for finding diverse speakers, to be used for running the
                operation and offering travel scholarships.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            One way we are supporting people is by identifying the different stages on their journey as a speaker. 
            We are currently looking at 3 different levels of experience:
        </p>
        <p class="stand-out-list">
            <b>SpeakEasy Speakers:</b> 1st timers in international conferences</br>
            <b>SpeakEasy Practitioners:</b> 2-5 timers, building experience but feeling mentor, perhaps a new one, is necessary.
                    These may also be people who submitted successfully without a mentor, and now do their first one mentored.</br>
            <b>SpeakEasy Professionals:</b> building up to regular speakers and keynoters.</br>
        </p>
        <i>For partner conference submissions, mention you are with SpeakEasy if you are either <b>SpeakEasy Speaker</b> or <b>SpeakEasy Practitioner</b>, 
        if you have been assigned or requested a mentor but are awaiting a mentor assignment.</i>
