    <p> Want to improve as a speaker? Or become a speaker in the first place?
        You don't need to do this alone, that is why SpeakEasy exists. We pair speakers with mentors at no cost to
        the speaker.</p>


    <p> To join as an aspiring speaker, let's start with meeting with a SpeakEasy representative.
      <a href="https://calendly.com/maaret-pyhajarvi/speakeasy-mentees">Schedule your
        half-an-hour discussion with Calendly here</a>. </p>

    <p>
        While we are excited to support a wide range of new speakers as you can read more about on
        our <a href="info.html">info page</a>.
        Given the general need of new voices, if we have limited mentor availability, we prioritize:<br>
    <p style="color:turquoise;"> women and non-binary<br>
        1st time international-big-conference speakers<br>
        talks on quality and testing topics for any conferences<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        SpeakEasy is a volunteer organization, and becoming a speaker is a process.
        Get matched with us early on to submit with our partner conferences.
        Finding you a mentor that can help you in a week may be too much of a stretch.
    <p>
        We look forward to working with you!
    <p>
