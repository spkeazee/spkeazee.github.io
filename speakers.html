    <h1> Speak Easy Eligibility</h1>

    <p><b>If you have spoken at a large conference that has paid you (this includes if you get free conference entry) you are not eligible for this initiative.</b></p>

    <p>If you want to be considered for a SpeakEasy Spot at one of our partnered conferences you must</p>

    <p>a) have signed up with SpeakEasy requesting a mentor (see form below)</p>

    <p>b) you must apply to a conference through our website to be considered a speakeasy candidate. You can of course submit to any conference without using this form, but you won’t be considered for the speakeasy spot if there is one allocated.</p>

    <p>c) We’d like you to be able to explain how you speaking at a conference can help increase diversity in conferences.</p>

    <p>A successful speakeasy candidate who get a speaker spot at a conference can continue to apply to partnered conferences through us for one year from the date of signing up.</p>

    <p>Still interested? Simply fill in the form and we’ll contact you shortly.</p>
