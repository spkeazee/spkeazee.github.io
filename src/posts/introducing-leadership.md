We believe in people to people, supported by an organization. SpeakEasy is on a mission to bring out new voices, supported by great people volunteering as mentors, conference organizers seeking new voices and speakers bringing their voices for others to learn from. We have a leadership team of four people, facilitating these connections and creating structures for our future success.

You can get in touch with any of the people in the leadership team personally. Each of us individually will bring things for consideration, and make the magic happen together with you.

## Abby Bangser (UK)

Abby is the glue that brings us all together, and has been defining a lot of the ways of working for Speak Easy. She is also the automation guru, and volunteer of all things technical. She's started off as an aspiring speaker, graduating from first talks to regular talks delivering great contents consistently. And now she is helping new speakers like herself get started through SpeakEasy.

## Ash Coleman (US)

Ash is the fresh voice of future in the new leadership team. She's a connection point to many conferences we work with, and takes up initiatives to improve SpeakEasy ways of working.

## Kristine Corbus (Germany)

Kristine is the heart of speaker - mentor pairings. She seeks for great matches in what people are interested in, and deals with all the introducing practicalities. She's been at it before the new leadership team and is a SpeakEasy senior.

Kristine is a software quality evangelist, meet-up founder, conference organiser, speaker, trainer and coach. Other words, she is seeker and shape shifter.

Living between two countries, three languages and many cultures, she is used to continuous improvement and feels like home with change and transition topics in tech. Kristīne loves to explain software quality and testing to developers and business people. She coaches software testers and QA engineers to think long term and business-oriented.

## Maaret Pyhäjärvi (Finland)

Maaret deals with financial structures, conference communication, Twitter communication and random web stuff. She's a serial mentor with SpeakEasy, who has been both actively paired through SpeakEasy enrollment channels and been found online by aspiring speakers, registering their mentorship with SpeakEasy later.

Maaret is also speaking a lot in conferences, meetups and webinars, doing about 30 sessions a year and totaling close to 400 sessions by now. She also organizes her own conference, European Testing Conference, that travels to different European locations every year.

Her day job is working as Senior Manager leading a team of 12 developers at F-Secure. She identifies still as tester, and is also liking the moniker polyglot programmer as something that describes her.
