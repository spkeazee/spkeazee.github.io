We are currently looking for both speakers and workshops, so whichever you would be more comfortable with would be great! Our budget for speakers is sparse, but we will be offering a few incentives.  
   * Speakers -  will receive an affiliate link, a few gifts, and the option to choose an open-source project that we will receive a 20% profit donated to them.
