Introducing TechVoices!

It was brought to our attention that the previous name we were operating under is trademark protected. The leadership team came to the conclusion that discussing this in American court system does not feel like our chosen freetime activity unlike connecting aspiring speakers, mentors and conferences, we immediately move to a new name.

Our website moves this weekend to [TechVoices.org](TechVoices.org). We'll leave a redirect in place from the old address.

At twitter, you find us at [http://twitter.com/tech_voices](@tech_voices).

At the same time, Kristine Corbus steps out of TechVoices Leadership team. We thank Kristine for her contributions and wish her well on her next volunteering choices.
