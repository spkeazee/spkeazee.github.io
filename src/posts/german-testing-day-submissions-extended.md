While we have previously [shared the German Testing Day partnership with SpeakEasy](https://speaking-easy.com/posts/announce-german-testing-day2020/), we have alloted a bit more time for SpeakEasy participants to craft their proposals and get a chance to join a fantastic event in Franfurt Germany.

Please view the original anouncement for full details or follow the instructions below for submitting your ideas.

How to Submit: Call for Proposals in [English](http://p352444.mittwaldserver.info/fileadmin/user_upload/5.0_GTD/2020/cfp/GTD_2020_Call_for_Papers_-_EN.pdf) or [German](https://www.germantestingday.info/german-testing-day-2020/programm/call-for-papers.html)
