    <h1>Leadership Team</h1>

    We believe in people to people, supported by an organization. SpeakEasy is on a mission,
    supported by great people volunteering as mentors, conference organizers seeking new voices
    and speakers bringing their voices for others to learn from. We have a leadership team of four people,
    facilitating these connections and creating structures for our future success.
    <p>
        You can get in touch with any of the people in the leadership team personally. Each of us individually
        will bring things for consideration, and make the magic happen together with you.
